# AWS_DATA_ENGINEERING_02
This project demonstrates real-time IoT data streaming using AWS Kinesis Data Streams, transformation with AWS Glue, and storage in Amazon S3. It showcases an end-to-end pipeline for scalable, serverless data processing.
Overview
This solution implements a serverless IoT data pipeline using AWS managed services. The architecture ingests high-velocity device data through Kinesis Data Streams, processes it with AWS Glue streaming ETL, and stores the transformed results in Amazon S3 for analytics.
Architecture Components
The solution comprises three core AWS services working in sequence. Kinesis Data Streams provides the ingestion layer, buffering incoming records with high durability. AWS Glue performs stream processing, including data validation, enrichment, and format conversion. Amazon S3 serves as the data lake storage layer, enabling integration with analytics services.
"Optional" components include AWS Lambda for event-driven processing and Amazon Athena for interactive querying. IAM roles and policies secure all service interactions, while CloudWatch provides operational monitoring.

#Implementation Methodology#
1.Data Ingestion Layer
Device data enters the pipeline through a Kinesis data stream configured with appropriate shard capacity. Producers use the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) or HTTP PUT records API to send data. The stream retains records for 24 hours by default, allowing for reprocessing if needed.

Each record should contain device metadata, sensor readings, and a timestamp in JSON format. For high-volume scenarios, implement partition keys to distribute load evenly across shards. Compression reduces network bandwidth usage for constrained devices.

2.Stream Processing Layer
AWS Glue streaming jobs process records in micro-batches, typically at 60-100 second intervals. The ETL job performs schema enforcement, dropping malformed records to a dead-letter queue. Common transformations include timestamp normalization, unit conversion, and field deduplication.

Glue auto-scales resources based on stream throughput, measured in Kinesis Processing Units (KPUs). Development endpoints allow testing transformations against sample data before deployment. Bookmarking ensures exactly-once processing when jobs restart.

3.Storage Layer
Processed data lands in S3 buckets organized by date partitions (e.g., year=2023/month=10/day=01). Parquet format provides columnar storage benefits for analytics. Lifecycle policies automatically transition older data to S3 Infrequent Access or Glacier.

Bucket policies restrict access to authorized services and users. S3 Event Notifications can trigger downstream processes when new data arrives. Multi-part uploads handle large files efficiently, while encryption protects data at rest.
